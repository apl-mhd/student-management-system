This is a local client project for a coaching center with over 700 students. My role is to develop an application that manages student enrollment, course and section assignments, billing, payments, SMS notifications, and report generation. I am building this project using Django, DRF, and Vue.js. As the sole developer, I chose a monolithic architecture for efficient development and management.

N.B: You may notice some ugly codes I will refactor this letter.
